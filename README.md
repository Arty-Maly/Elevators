# Elevators
Final Elevators assignment


I decided to let the simulation class tell the elevator to change its state (move up, down etc)
The building class creates the floors and elavators. Then the floors each create a queue of 10 people with randomized destinations
The elevator visits each floor and load unloads people based on elevator capacity. So the elevator would stop at a floor check if anyone needs to leave and then lets people board
The simulation runs for 35 ticks with two elevators, five floors and maximum capacity of 3 per elevator
